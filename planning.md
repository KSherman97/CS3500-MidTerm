# Planning / Ideas 

## website type / basic info
Initially we were thinking about having a sports website, however I feel like with neither of us knowing too much about sports we may struggle to produce content. 
An alternative idea would be to have a catalog website. Based off of another project I have done in the past for a C# class, I was thinking of making a catalog for wine or something similar. 
While, I don't know a lot about the product itself - from that previous project I have access to basic info for a wide selection of products. 

This would allow us to expand upon the backend infrustructer later on by automating some of the task with PHP or another language to interact with items stored in a SQL database.
